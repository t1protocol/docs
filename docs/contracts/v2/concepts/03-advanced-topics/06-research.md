# The Rollup Fragmentation Problem

Authors: Can Kisagun, CEO & Co-founder of 𝚝𝟷

> Rollups, which execute transactions outside of Ethereum (off-chain) and post integrity (execution) proofs and transaction data to Layer 1 for verification, have scaled Ethereum in a secure and performant way, enabling significant reduction in transaction fees and improvements in user experience. However, while improving scalability, rollups also introduced siloed execution that led to liquidity fragmentation and broke composability in Ethereum. In this article, we talk about the rollup fragmentation problem, its implications for users and developers, and we explore how emerging technologies can restore composability. Ethereum ultimately needs to provide a unified and composable ecosystem where users can interact with different applications seamlessly, across rollups. To get there, the focus must be on shared sequencing and real-time proof generation.
