# Research
The rollup landscape is changing rapidly, and we at 𝚝𝟷 strive to stay at the bleeding edge. Our research focuses on improving scalable composability among and between blockchains and rollups.

## The Rollup Fragmentation Problem

Authors: Can Kisagun, CEO & Co-founder of 𝚝𝟷

> Rollups, which execute transactions outside of Ethereum (off-chain) and post integrity (execution) proofs and transaction data to Layer 1 for verification, have scaled Ethereum in a secure and performant way, enabling significant reduction in transaction fees and improvements in user experience. However, while improving scalability, rollups also introduced siloed execution that led to liquidity fragmentation and broke composability in Ethereum. In this article, we talk about the rollup fragmentation problem, its implications for users and developers, and we explore how emerging technologies can restore composability. Ethereum ultimately needs to provide a unified and composable ecosystem where users can interact with different applications seamlessly, across rollups. To get there, the focus must be on shared sequencing and real-time proof generation.

## Introducing **𝚝𝟷:** Unifying Ethereum’s Ecosystem for the Future of Web3

> Today, we are excited to share more about 𝚝𝟷 and our journey. We believe Ethereum should not only be the most decentralized smart contracting ecosystem but also the blockchain with the best user and developer experience.
Ethereum best embodies the ethos and values that inspire us about the future of blockchain technology. It has the most decentralized community—a place where the brightest minds gather and innovation thrives. However, the best technology doesn’t always win.
We believe that for Ethereum to provide the best user and developer experience, the rollup fragmentation problem must be solved. The vision of a unified Ethereum ecosystem truly excites us. We started 𝚝𝟷 earlier this year to make this vision a reality.
