## Introduction

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are specialized hardware-based environments that isolate sensitive computations and data from the rest of the system, ensuring that data is processed correctly and privately. In particular, TEEs provide verifiable computation guarantees through a process called “Remote Attestation”, which proves to external parties that the TEE is running a specific, unmodified piece of software (bytecode) without any tampering. Verifiers can then use this proof to confirm that the TEE and its output is trustworthy. Additionally, TEEs can preserve privacy by keeping sensitive data and execution logic concealed from the system operator and external observers. In other words, TEEs are secure hardware areas that protect sensitive data and computations from tampering or unauthorized access.
