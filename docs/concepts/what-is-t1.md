𝚝𝟷 is a rollup designed to fix fragmentation and other composability challenges in scaling Ethereum. By leveraging AVS-secured Trusted Execution Environments, 𝚝𝟷 introduces real-time proofs (RTP) that prove the integrity of 𝚝𝟷 execution to Ethereum in less than 12 seconds. RTP enables instant settlement on Ethereum and therefore composability across different rollups. 𝚝𝟷’s mission is to unify Ethereum and the rollup ecosystem to provide a superior UX.
