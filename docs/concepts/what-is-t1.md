t1 is an EVM-based cross-chain application infrastructure that introduces Real-Time Proving (RTP) and programmability to address fragmentation and composability challenges in scaling Ethereum: 

- Real-time proving: Using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), 𝚝𝟷 proves its execution integrity to Ethereum and partner rollups in under 12 seconds. By running partner rollup nodes within its infrastructure, 𝚝𝟷 aggregates and proves their state to Ethereum in 1-2 L1 blocks—enabling instant settlement between Ethereum and any partner rollup.
- Programmability: t1 smart contracts are able to read from and write to Ethereum and partner rollups

The result: t1 provides the missing infrastructure for seamless cross-chain applications and liquidity movement—today.
